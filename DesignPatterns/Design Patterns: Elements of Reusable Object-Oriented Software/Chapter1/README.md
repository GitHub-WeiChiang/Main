* ### In general, a pattern has four essential elements:
    * ### The ```pattern name``` is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or two.
    * ### The ```problem``` describes when to apply the pattern.
    * ### The ```solution``` describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
    * ### The ```consequences``` are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.
